<p>This post is going to focus on Agile and two versions of Agile that
are used in modern software development. First we will focus on Scrum
and then move onto Kanban.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-agile">What is Agile?</h3>
<p>First, we should focus on the definition of Agile and implementations
that exist within the DevOps world. According to the Agile Manifesto
website, the core of Agile is to bring people back into the construction
of software, breaking down communication barriers between developers,
project managers, and other members of the team. The final core is the
idea of embracing change. There are two versions of Agile we will be
talking about in this post. The first version is known as Scrum and the
second is known as Kanban.</p>
<h4 id="scrum">Scrum</h4>
<p>The most important aspect of Scrum to remember is the backlog. The
backlog is just a prioritized list of issues or features to work on.
Development teams using Scrum usually work in sprints where the team
works to complete a set amount of work in a set amount of time. The
amount of work is usually decided before the sprint takes place so the
team isn’t overwhelmed or only implementing half-baked features. The aim
of the sprint is by the end to have produced a shippable version of the
product so that updates and features are constantly being added. Think
of the product like a software, for example, a video game, where updates
are constantly happening to fix bugs and take input from the
community.</p>
<p>A sprint begins with a planning session that is used to define what
items from the backlog can be delivered upon and how that work will be
accomplished. The first half of the session is between the development
team and the product owner where they discuss which items will be
accepted into the sprint, usually only the items the team thinks they
have a shot of completing within the set time. In the second half of the
session, the developers will break down individual stores into tasks to
help the team accomplish their respective duties.</p>
<p>While the sprint is ongoing, each workday begins with a standup where
the product owner, team leader, and the development team discuss what
work was done the previous day and what work they plan to do that day.
They will also discuss if they have any blockers preventing the team
from working on an item from the backlog. The meetings are generally
short and only one person is allowed to speak at a time for a max of
generally a minute. At the end of a sprint, the sprint review takes
place. The first portion is the demo of the completed work that is shown
to the stakeholders and the second portion is the sprint lookback. The
sprint lookback is a chance for the team to look back at how the sprint
went and how they could improve and who can improve. A burn-up chart is
also usually kept to track the team’s progress within the sprint which
can be used to see if the backlog can be completed within the time frame
or not.</p>
<h4 id="kanban">Kanban</h4>
<p>Kanban is more flexible than Scrum as it only has three
principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make all work visible</li>
<li>Limit work in progress</li>
<li>Practice continual self-improvement</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, many teams can find Kanban harder to implement. However,
since Kanban is so flexible it can be rendered in a way that is just the
right fit for your team. Typically, Kanban implements the use of a board
where all team members can see where all tasks lay in implementation.
Teams typically work on one task at a time rather than having multiple
tasks being rendered out at one like in a sprint. When an item is
completed, work can be focused on the next priority. This allows teams
to have fast responses to changes. Work-in-progress limits are also
often defined before any work begins. These are limits on the number of
items that can be in any given column at a time. This prevents code from
sitting there for too long and time being wasted. While Kanban does not
require meetings like Scrum, teams often will meet at the same frequency
to Scrum teams to allow teams to know of any upcoming work and get
progress reports. Similar to the burn-up chart in Scrum, Kanban uses a
continuous flow diagram (CFD), a line chart that shows how many items
are in each column in a system at a given time. Reasonably, these lines
should be kept flat to prevent work build-up. The last important aspect
of Kanban is the topic of continuous improvement, one of the pillars of
Kanban. Teams will often meet and discuss any shortcomings of other team
members and how they could improve for the future. This also applies to
the work done as it can identify issues right away instead of later down
the time and being corrects promptly.</p>
