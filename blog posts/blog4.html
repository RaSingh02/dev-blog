<h2 id="randeep-singh">Randeep Singh</h2>
<h2 id="march-1-2022">March 1, 2022</h2>
<p>This post focuses on the main three different types of databases and
the differences between SQL and NoSQL.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-databases">Types of Databases</h3>
<p>There are three general database types based on the following
models:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Relational Database</li>
<li>Non-Relational Database</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Database</li>
</ol>
<p>We will be taking a look at all three types of databases. The main
difference between them is the way information looks inside the
database, as such each model has its own management system and data
relationships.</p>
<h4 id="relational-database">Relational Database</h4>
<p>The relational database is the most used out of the three and is the
oldest model. There are three critical components of this database:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Rows</li>
<li>Columns</li>
</ol>
<p>Using a query language, most commonly SQL, or Structured Query
Language, a relational database provides a set of data rows in response
to a query. Relational databases are most commonly used for online
transaction systems where support for many users and frequent queries
are needed to complete online transactions. They are also used in IoT,
the Internet of Things, devices since they are lightweight and have the
processing power needed for edge computing. Where the device connects to
a network to deliver and receive instructions from a central server,
most likely the cloud or a data center. Relational databases are also
used in data warehouses where mass storage can be easily integrated and
optimized for mass queries from multiple sources.</p>
<h4 id="non-relational-database-nosql">Non-Relational Database
(NoSQL)</h4>
<p>This type of database stores data differently from relational
databases. There are four different types of NoSQL databases types:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Document</li>
<li>Key-Value</li>
<li>Column based</li>
<li>Graph</li>
</ol>
<p>Non-relational databases are known to be flexible as they can easily
handle different levels of data easily, from structured to unstructured.
They can also scale well with on-demand servers and can provide quick
query responses. Due to their real-time data replication, they have
limited downtime which is beneficial towards large data centers, such as
those that Google has. The scalability of cloud-computing architecture
scales beautifully with non-relational databases as well. NoSQL
databases are generally used for real-time systems as they provide agile
real-time and combine operational and analytical systems into one. They
can be customized to fit any users’ needs as they have elastic scaling.
Since NoSQL has low latency, they are used in financial systems to
detect fraud quickly and efficiently.</p>
<h4 id="object-database">Object Database</h4>
<p>This type of database represents data similar to that of objects in
an object-oriented programming language. There are four critical
components of an object database:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Pointers</li>
</ol>
<p>Object databases combine concepts from object-oriented programming
with database capabilities. Due to the nature of this database, data is
easy to retrieve and save. It also helps with modeling as real-world
issues and information are more closely related to objects, making
complex tasks easier to model and solve. With user-defined classes,
custom and complex data types can be created to fit the users’ needs.
This database also combines seamlessly with object-oriented programming
languages such as Java. Due to ACID compliance, transactions can occur
with conflicting changes. These databases are great for high-performance
applications where fast data retrieval is necessary. Scientific data
calculation and storage are also compatible as complex data can easily
be defined and stored to the users’ needs.</p>
