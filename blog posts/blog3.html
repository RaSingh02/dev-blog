<p>This post focuses on Modern Javascript and the differences between
OOP and Functional Programming.</p>
<h3 id="modern-javascript">Modern Javascript</h3>
<p>Javascript is one of the most used platforms for application and
website development to this day. In the beginning, due to the lack of
back-end support and lack of technologies, Javascript was mostly used
for front-end development. The creation of other technologies, such as
NodeJS, allowed Javascript to work as the main back-end handler. NodeJS
allowed Javascript to run like a server and not only inside the browser.
With the creation of NodeJS came out NPM, or Node Package Manager. This
allowed Javascript to become fully fleshed out with a package manager
with modules similar to libraries in another language such as
Python.</p>
<h3 id="oop-vs.-functional-programming">OOP vs.Â Functional
Programming</h3>
<p>Functional programming is a programming technique that accentuates
the functional factors required for creating and implementing programs.
It uses a declarative programming model where the variables and
functions are the key elements. Due to the definition of functional
programming, it is great for data science work, with the language R
being the most popular among data scientists. It provides advantages
such as efficiency, lazy evaluation, nested functions, bug-free code,
and parallel programming. In other words, functional programming is to
write statements that execute a particular task for the application
within the function itself. Functions can be easily reused and invoked
at any time. This helps ensure the code stays easily readable and saves
time and effort recoding things that already have been created
beforehand. Functional programming is based on six different
concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>High Order Functions (HOF)</li>
<li>Pure functions</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Strict and Non-strict evaluation</li>
<li>Type systems</li>
<li>Referential Transparency</li>
</ol>
<p>Functional languages are good for when you have a fixed set of things
and as your code evolved, you add new operations on top of the existing
ones. This is primarily accomplished through the use of new functions
that use existing data types and existing functions already made.</p>
<p>On the other hand, object-oriented programming is a conceptual
programming technique that uses objects as the keys. As such, it is an
imperative programming model that uses objects and methods as the key
elements. There are four main concepts for object-oriented
programming:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
</ol>
<p>In an object-oriented programming language, the objects can be easily
reused in another application. In addition, new objects can be easily
created for the same class, and code can be easily maintained and
altered when the need arises. With this, comes the benefit of memory
management. This is fantastic for creating large programs which then can
be divided into smaller pieces and helps to plan out certain components
or phases in their own unique ways. Object-oriented languages are good
for when you have a set of fixed operations on things and as your code
evolves you add new things. This can either be accomplished with the use
of new classes that reuse existing methods or existing classes that are
already made.</p>
<p>There are programming languages that support both. For example,
Python and Java both support object-oriented concepts and functional
concepts by supporting various inbuilt functions are can be imported
through the use of external libraries that others have built.</p>
