<p>This post focuses on the rise of User-Experience Design in the past
couple of decades and how search engine optimization has become such a
critical role in directing traffic to your site.</p>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-user-experience-design">The Rise of User-Experience
Design</h3>
<p>What is User Experience Design? User Experience is the feeling a user
experience while interacting with a website or application. The user
experience is a critical step in the development cycle as it focuses on
fulfilling the user’s needs or desires. User experience is also a
strategic method to help avoid expensive revisions down the line.
Companies can not change whole elements on their products without
foreseeing the consequences of such changes. Interfaces need to be fluid
and evolve as the userbases’ needs change. Fluid discussion and user
testing are vital in order to allow interfaces to behave as such. By
creating low fidelity and interactive prototypes in front of users, the
UX team is able to identify issues early on and work towards fixing them
and also find more effective solutions using user feedback. By creating
these quick interactive mockups, discovery costs are low as a result
while fluid paths can be sketched out to many different solutions. By
understanding user experience, a company can effectively allocate its
resources. A good application is reliant on strong communication between
departments, management, creativity, and userbase.</p>
<h3 id="search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</h3>
<p>What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)? SEO is the process of
improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for
products or services related to your business in many different search
engines, such as Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc. The better visibility
your website has in search results, the more likely you are to garner
attention and attract prospective customers to your business. SEO is the
foundation of a holistic marketing ecosystem. When you understand what
your userbase wants, you can implement that knowledge across your
campaigns, your website, and social media properties. Keeping up with
current trends is also important, just like when producing ad campaigns.
By storing headers or other page content in media that is not text, it
can make it difficult for search engine algorithms to identify. That is
why using the “alt” in image tags is so important to allow search
engines to recognize that content on the page. Using title tags is also
very important, as many search engines will use those tags to display
search results to the user. Adding descriptive meta tags helps as well,
as search engines will often display these as page snippets under the
title tags. Make sure to update your themes to account for seasonal
changes as a specific seasonal-themed website may get fewer results
shown in other seasons.</p>
